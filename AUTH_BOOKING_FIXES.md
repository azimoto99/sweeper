# Authentication & Booking Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… User Profile Not Saved to Database
**Problem**: Users were created in Supabase Auth but profiles weren't being saved to the `users` table.

**Solution**: 
- Created database triggers to automatically create user profiles when email is confirmed
- Fixed RLS policies to allow profile creation during signup
- Added fallback profile creation in the auth hook
- Created manual fix function for existing users

### 2. âœ… Email Verification Redirect Issue  
**Problem**: After email verification, users were redirected to landing page instead of dashboard.

**Solution**:
- Updated `AuthCallbackPage.tsx` to redirect to `/dashboard` instead of `/`
- Added authentication check to landing page to redirect logged-in users
- Improved auth state handling for email confirmation

### 3. âœ… Resend Email Not Working
**Problem**: Resend verification email button wasn't working properly.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `resendVerificationEmail` function with better error handling
- Added proper redirect URL to resend requests
- Improved logging for debugging

### 4. âœ… Custom Email Templates
**Problem**: Default Supabase emails didn't mention "Sweeper".

**Solution**:
- Created custom email template (`supabase/templates/confirm.html`)
- Updated Supabase config to use custom template
- Branded email with Sweeper logo and styling

### 5. âœ… Booking Price Calculation
**Problem**: Total price wasn't updating when add-ons were selected.

**Solution**:
- Fixed `useEffect` dependencies in `BookingPage.tsx` to include `profile`
- Ensured pricing recalculates when add-ons change
- Verified pricing calculator logic is working correctly

### 6. âœ… Landing Page Improvements
**Problem**: Landing page wasn't well-integrated and had non-functional elements.

**Solution**:
- Added authentication redirect to send logged-in users to dashboard
- Improved user experience flow

4. Click confirmation link
5. Verify redirect to dashboard
6. Check that user profile exists in database

4. Verify new email is sent

#### Test Booking Pricing:

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] New users can sign up successfully
- [ ] User profiles are created in database
- [ ] Email confirmation works and redirects to dashboard
- [ ] Resend email functionality works
- [ ] Custom email template is used
- [ ] Booking price calculation updates with add-ons
- [ ] Logged-in users are redirected from landing page

## Database Schema Verification

Check that these tables have the expected data:

```sql
-- Check users table
SELECT id, email, full_name, role, created_at FROM users ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Check workers table (for worker accounts)
SELECT profile_id, status, created_at FROM workers ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Check auth users vs app users
SELECT 
  au.email,
  au.email_confirmed_at,
  pu.full_name,
  pu.role
FROM auth.users au
LEFT JOIN public.users pu ON au.id = pu.id
ORDER BY au.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Users Still Can't Sign Up:
1. Check Supabase logs for errors
2. Verify RLS policies are correct
3. Ensure triggers are created properly
4. Check that email confirmation is enabled in Supabase settings

### If Emails Aren't Branded:
1. Verify custom template path in config.toml
2. Restart Supabase local instance
3. Check template file exists and is valid HTML

### If Pricing Doesn't Update:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify `formData.add_ons` is updating correctly
3. Check that `useEffect` dependencies include all necessary values

## Production Deployment Notes

1. **Email Templates**: Upload custom templates to your production Supabase project
2. **Database Triggers**: Run the SQL fixes in production database
3. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all auth redirect URLs are correct for production
4. **Testing**: Test the complete signup flow in production environment

## Future Improvements

1. **Email Customization**: Add more email templates (password reset, welcome, etc.)
2. **User Onboarding**: Add guided tour for new users
3. **Landing Page**: Consider A/B testing different landing page designs
4. **Pricing Display**: Add real-time pricing preview as users select options
