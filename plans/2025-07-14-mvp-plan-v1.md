# MVP Implementation Plan

## Objective
The objective of this plan is to outline the necessary steps to bring the "sweeper" application to a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) state. The MVP will focus on the core functionality of allowing customers to book services, workers to fulfill them, and admins to manage the process.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Flesh out Authentication**
  - Dependencies: None
  - Notes: Implement the UI and logic for password reset and email verification. Currently, these are placeholder components.
  - Files: `src/components/auth/ResetPasswordPage.tsx`, `src/components/auth/VerifyEmailPage.tsx`
  - Status: Not Started
2. **Implement Customer Booking Flow**
  - Dependencies: Task 1
  - Notes: Develop the UI and logic for the `BookingPage` to allow customers to select a service, choose a date and time, and confirm a booking. This will likely involve integrating with a payment provider like PayPal.
  - Files: `src/components/booking/BookingPage.tsx`, `src/components/products/ProductsPage.tsx`, `src/components/payment/PayPalButton.tsx`
  - Status: Not Started
3. **Develop Worker Application**
  - Dependencies: Task 2
  - Notes: Create the interface for workers to view their assigned bookings, update the status of a booking (e.g., "in progress", "completed"), and view their work history.
  - Files: `src/components/worker/WorkerApp.tsx`
  - Status: Not Started
4. **Build Admin Management Features**
  - Dependencies: Task 2
  - Notes: Implement the admin dashboard features for managing workers and bookings. The `DispatchCenter` needs to be built to allow admins to assign new bookings to available workers.
  - Files: `src/components/admin/DispatchCenter.tsx`, and the placeholder components within `src/App.tsx` for `AdminRoutes`.
  - Status: Not Started
5. **Refine User Profile and Subscription Management**
  - Dependencies: Task 1
  - Notes: Enhance the `ProfilePage` to allow users to manage their personal information. Implement the `SubscriptionsPage` for customers to manage recurring service subscriptions.
  - Files: `src/components/profile/ProfilePage.tsx`, `src/components/subscriptions/SubscriptionsPage.tsx`
  - Status: Not Started

## Verification Criteria
- A new user can sign up, verify their email, and log in.
- A logged-in customer can view products/services and book one.
- A worker can log in and see a list of their assigned jobs.
- An admin can log in, view all bookings, and assign a booking to a worker.
- The payment flow for a booking is functional.

## Potential Risks and Mitigations
1. **Incomplete Supabase Policies**: The `supabase/rls-policies.sql` may not be complete, leading to security vulnerabilities.
  - Mitigation: Review and test all Row Level Security policies for each user role to ensure data is properly protected.
2. **Payment Integration Complexity**: Integrating with PayPal can be complex and may have edge cases that are not initially considered.
  - Mitigation: Thoroughly test the payment flow in a sandbox environment, including successful payments, failed payments, and refunds.
3. **Mapbox API Usage**: The `DispatchCenter` and `WorkerApp` may require complex Mapbox integration for location tracking and routing, which can be challenging.
  - Mitigation: Start with basic map display and marker functionality, and incrementally add more complex features like routing and geofencing.

## Alternative Approaches
1. **Phased MVP Rollout**: Instead of building all features at once, you could release the MVP in phases. For example, launch with only the customer booking flow and manual admin assignment, and then add the worker app in a later release.
2. **Simplified Admin Interface**: Instead of a full-featured admin dashboard, you could use the Supabase Studio as the admin interface for MVP to save development time.
